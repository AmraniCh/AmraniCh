### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shakir, a Software Developer based in Tangier, Morocco, I love understanding how things work behind the scenes and use this knowledge to solve problems and build better software.

Recently, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software and Web Development with the highest honors.

Currently, I work for an email marketing company as a Software Developer in the IT department.

I have the passion for working on open source since I discovered GitHub, I love working on projects that are for everyone and to contribute in my part to the evolution of technology in the world.

Also, I enjoy learning everyday about internet protocols and security, networking and programming languages & frameworks internals .., in the near future I plan to post articles about these topics and share what I know with others.

That is a short brief about me, I'm looking forward to new opportunities and projects, if you have something for me or for the benefit of the world don't hesitate to contact me.

If you find yourself almost like me then welcome to the club ðŸ˜Š
